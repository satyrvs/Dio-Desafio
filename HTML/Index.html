            Love, love, love
            Love, love, love
            Love, love, love
            There's nothin' you can do that can't be done
            Nothin' you can sing that can't be sung
            Nothin' you can say, but you can learn how to play the game
            It's easy
            Nothin' you can make that can't be made
            No one you can save that can't be saved
            Nothin' you can do, but you can learn how to be you in time
            It's easy
            All you need is love
            All you need is love
            All you need is love, love
            Love is all you need
            All you need is love
            All you need is love
            All you need is love, love
            Love is all you need
            There's nothin' you can know that isn't known
            Nothin' you can see that isn't shown
            There's nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be
            It's easy
            All you need is love
            All you need is love
            All you need is love, love
            Love is all you need
            All you need is love (all together now)
            All you need is love (everybody)
